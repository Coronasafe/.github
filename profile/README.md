# Reimagining Healthcare Delivery

**Open Healthcare Network (OHC)**, originally established as *Coronasafe Network*, is a pioneering open-source organization dedicated to enhancing healthcare delivery and management. At the core of OHC's innovation is its flagship Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, recognized as the [50th Digital Public Good by the United Nations](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/). This system transcends being merely a digital repository of patient records, evolving into a platform that supports advanced TeleICU capabilities.
